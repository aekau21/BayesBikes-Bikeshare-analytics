#### About the Project:

This project uses a dataset from the bayesrules package in R, which contains daily ridership data for the Capital Bikeshare service in Washington, D.C. The dataset includes 13 variables capturing various factors that influence bike usage, such as the date, season, weather conditions, temperature, and whether the rides were made by registered or casual riders.
The objective of this project was to create an interactive Shiny app that allows users to input specific information (such as season, weather conditions, temperature, ect) and receive a distribution of the expected number of rides. By utilizing the dataset's features, the app aims to explore and predict ridership trends, which can provide insights into how external factors like holidays, weekends, and weather affect bike usage.
